.SH NAME
firewire\-request \- query and configure FireWire devices
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B firewire\-request
.RI [ options ]
.I device
.I command
.RI [ parameters ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B firewire\-request
is a utility to query and configure FireWire devices.
.PP
The
.I device
parameter specifies the device file
.RB ( /dev/fw *)
of the device that is to be accessed.
.PP
All numbers must be specified in hexadecimal notation.
.
When specifying data blocks, you can separate bytes or quadlets with spaces,
but then you have to remember to quote them in the shell
so that all bytes are recognized as a single parameter.
.PP
In the following commands,
.I address
is either a 48-bit address or a register name.
.PP
The following commands are available:
.TP
\fBfirewire\-request\fP \fIdevice\fP \fBread\fP \fIaddress\fP [\fIlength\fP]
Sends a read request to the device
and prints the value returned by the device, if successful.
.IP
If
.I length
is not specified, it is derived from
.IR address :
for a named register, the register's length is used;
for a numerical address, a default length of one quadlet (4\~bytes) is used.
.TP
\fBfirewire\-request\fP \fIdevice\fP \fBwrite\fP|\fBbroadcast\fP \fIaddress\fP \fIdata\fP
Sends a write request to the device.
.IP
Broadcasts are allowed only for a
.I device
that corresponds to a local controller,
and are sent to all the other devices on the bus.
.TP
\fBfirewire\-request\fP \fIdevice locktype address data \fP[\fIdata2\fP]
Executes a lock transaction (an atomic change) on the device.
.IP
.I locktype
can be any of the following:
.RS
.TP
.B mask_swap
Changes the bits set in
.I data
to the value in
.IR data2 .
.TP
.B compare_swap
If the register has the same value as
.IR data ,
set it to
.IR data2 .
.TP
.BR add [ _big ]
Increase the register by
.IR data .
.TP
.B add_little
Increase the little-endian register by
.IR data .
.TP
.BR bounded_add [ _big ]
If the register has not the the same values as
.IR data ,
increase it by
.IR data2 .
.TP
.BR wrap_add [ _big ]
If the register has not the the same values as
.IR data ,
increase it by
.IR data2 ,
else set it to
.IR data2 .
.RE
.IP
All transaction types except
.BR add / add_big / add_little
require two parameters.
.IP
.B firewire\-request
will print the value returned by the device,
which is the old register value at the beginning of the transaction.
.TP
\fBfirewire\-request\fP \fIdevice\fP \fBfcp\fP \fIdata\fP
Sends the message
.I data
to the device's FCP command register,
and prints the response returned by the device
to the local FCP response register.
.TP
\fBfirewire\-request\fP \fIdevice\fP \fBreset\fP|\fBlong_reset\fP
Issues a bus reset on the bus connected to
.IR device .
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-D, \-\-dump\-register\-names
Print register names that can be used as
.IR address ,
and exit.
.TP
.B \-v, \-\-verbose
When used together with
.BR \-\-dump\-register\-names ,
print the complete list of register names.
.TP
.B \-h, \-\-help
Print a summary of the command-line options and exit.
.TP
.B \-V, \-\-version
Print the version number of
.B firewire\-request
on the standard output and exit.
.SH NOTES
Whether you can access a device depends on the permissions set for its device file.
.
Usually, most devices require root privileges.
